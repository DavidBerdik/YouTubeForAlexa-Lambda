# YouTube for Alexa - AWS Lambda Function
This repository contains the contents of the `YouTubeForAlexaLambda.zip` file from the [YouTubeForAlexa Project](https://github.com/wes1993/YouTubeForAlexa). The original project repository only provides this file in a zipped format, however, providing the contents of this file in an unzipped format has several advantages such as enabling the use of GitHub's code search functionality, easier identification of the code changes made in each release, and—personally—a Git repository in which I can store my own modifications to the code.

My intention is to keep the contents of the `master` branch of this repository in line with the current state of the `master` branch on the original repository, however, I have listed the hash of the current state of the master branch of the repository below to ensure that if I do not adhere to that, it does not cause confusion. The only modifications made to the `master` branch as compared to the original file are the addition of a `.gitattributes` file and renaming the `README.md` file contained within the original `zip` to `README - Lambda.md` to accomodate the creation of this `README`. Any additional branches on this repository will contain my own custom modifications to the code. I will not merge these branches in to `master` unless the maintainer of the original repo merges my changes in to their code first.

## Current state of master branch: [`7b38a14`](https://github.com/wes1993/YouTubeForAlexa/commit/7b38a149899c4c207fe92ce822b91854471f3a16)*

\* This information can only be considered up to date if viewed from the `master` branch. When viewed from any other branch, it may be outdated.
